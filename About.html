                <h3>22 Years Of Shree Marutinandan Restaurants!</h3>
                <p>
                    Shree Marutinandan Restaurants today is not only the most widespread chain of restaurants
                    in Ahmedabad but also has successfully carved out its identity as the most authentic
                    Kathiyawadi cuisine-serving restaurants. Alongside that, you will also find a wide range
                    of Punjabi, Chinese, and selected delicacies from Rajasthani and Continental cuisines.
                    The reason behind choosing Kathiyawadi cuisine to start with was simple â€“ Amdavadis loved
                    Kathiyawadi cuisine, but there were few serving the delicacies with an authentic taste.
                    The early few restaurants that were opened (still serving guests) not only served the real
                    taste but also had a traditional Khaatla-Bethak sitting arrangement that became an identity
                    of the restaurants. Today, out of the 16 branches, many have modern aesthetics, interiors,
                    and ambiance, along with banquet halls and gardens. Over the years, our efforts, from
                    introducing new delicacies or cuisines to opening new branches with unique interiors, have
                    all been embraced with love by the taste lovers. With restaurants in almost every corner
                    of Ahmedabad, we would like to say a big thank you for your support and love.
